      "I honestly like him as a person more than just a hot guy I could bone or a potential boyfriend. If we just hung out looking at records, watching bad tv, arguing about hip hop and seeing bands together I'd be completely fine with it. As of tomorrow night I sent him a text [just to say if he was up late on Saturday after work to hit me up, which I'll say does real like a BOOTY CALL -it was ok- so that could be cause of avoidance too] but it has been a week with no signs of life. Since I do like him as a friend and keep hoping he'll reappear for the same reasons I'm trying not to have some girly flip out where I make assumptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not going to lie: he is hot in a tattooed/pierced and kind of rough way. If he wasn't completely antisocial and shy he'd be pulling a ton of girls in this city. He just has little-to-no game and also he's fairly insecure with low self esteem. The girl he was dating chased him, is rather fat/plump and was dating someone else when she met him. I'm sitting here on the sidelines thinking \"wow he dated some girl he wasn't into enough to have communicated a level of interest to her and I'm sitting here with NO communication except maybe once a week!?!\" Even though it does read like he's just not that into you I kind of feel like he needs women to chase him partly; Like I need men to chase me. So I suppose in a way I'd like to bring him out and just directly talk to him about it rather than stab in the dark at his MOs. Even if it's just closure somehow that he didn't like me \"as a friend\" and/or was just trying to see if he could get it in! We're not super tight but I'd like to at least be friendly even if it's just someone to hit up when I wanna go see bands with another person. [Or grab falafel with a pal]\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to think of a text to construct as a last ditch \"c'mon dude, I promise not to rape you\" communication. I'm taking your advice under consideration and *I think I'm going to ask if he's into just going to the record store, grabbing vegan food together and hanging out when he's free and saying I like him as a friend a lot AND I WON'T RAPE HIM even though sex / making out is FINE it's not my total mo with him.*\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I'd fall in love with him because if we kept hooking up or having sex I'd stop before I got emotionally invested. I've learned where my line is and when to just squash it. I didn't communicate a lot with him the last time we hung out about boundaries and rules and what is this?? kind of thing because I didn't *mean to fuck him* and was trying NOT to do just that really. Honestly I do want a boyfriend, monogamy, a relationship, commitment and that kind of deal. He has told me in every way that he just got out of a year+ relationship, just got back home to Oregon and he's NOT looking to be back in anything serious. \n",
      "\n",
      "He has some serious, serious commitment issues and I think being in a relationship or having things defined pushes his freak out button(s) in a major way. I think expressing any form of attachment or love or commitment or expectations would make him turn, run far away and freak the fuck out. I think he likes the idea of a relationship or he likes casual \"I will never see this person again or do not like this person really\" situations more than things that could be good/promising/extended. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of the above is why I suspect he's sitting at home avoiding me. [And why I don't think I'd \"fall in love\" with him to answer your question. Mainly because doing so would be counter intuitive an approach to someone like this guy]\n",
